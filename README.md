- Hi there! Welcome to the Lesson Plans for the Portable Analog Computer!
- Team members: Gabriel Saucedo, Mercedes Murrillo, Arturo Bencomo

- Analog computation has been around for a long time, given that it is a predecessor to the modern day,
  digital-based design approach of computation. As we reach closer and closer to the physical limitations
  of transistor manufacturing, it is getting more clear that we will be needing an alternative in the close
  future. One of our solutions is to go back in time and examine the world's analogous signals to be able to
  better understand it and find a potential alternative to digital computation where possible.

- Our goal is create an Analog Computer that is both accessible and afforable for general users. In these Lesson
  Plans, we will be exploring models based on mathematical equations that are able to be used in the Analog
  Computer as inputs; these inputs will then be fed into specific IC configurations, such as Integrators, Summers,
  and Multipliers, in order to produce the desired output signal. Once the signal is exerted, we will be able to
  manipulate the input signals via our control potentiometers in order to observe how the signals change in a
  continuous setting.
